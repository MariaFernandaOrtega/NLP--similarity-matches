# NLP-Based Similarity Analysis: GSS 2025 & T20 Communiqué

This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess the **thematic alignment** between sustainability-related **action points** from the *Global Solutions Summit (GSS) 2025* and the **policy recommendations** from the *T20 Communiqué*. The analysis focuses on identifying overlapping themes and shared policy priorities by measuring **semantic similarity** between texts.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To determine how closely the GSS 2025 sustainability sessions align with the T20’s formal policy recommendations by:
- Extracting and segmenting key texts
- Computing semantic similarity between action items and recommendations
- Presenting the top sentence matches and shared thematic areas
